Project Title: Analyzing Factors Influencing Song Popularity Using Spotify Dataset <br>

Introduction: <br>
This project aims to analyze a dataset related to songs and playlists on Spotify to gain insights into the factors that contribute to a song's popularity. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains comprehensive information about over 600,000 songs on Spotify, including audio features, popularity scores, and playlist data. By leveraging Python and various data analysis techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships that can shed light on the elements that make a song popular.

Dataset:<br>
The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle (provide link). It consists of a vast collection of song-related information, including audio features such as danceability, energy, loudness, and acousticness, among others. Additionally, it includes popularity scores and playlist data, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of the factors influencing song popularity.

Technologies Used: <br>
To perform the analysis, we utilized the following technologies and tools:

Python 3: The primary programming language used for data analysis and manipulation. <br>
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive coding environment that enables us to document our analysis process and share it seamlessly. <br>
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library in Python used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis. <br>
NumPy: A library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, facilitating efficient numerical computations. <br>
Matplotlib: A popular data visualization library used to create informative and visually appealing graphs and charts. <br>
Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library that enhances the visual aesthetics of Matplotlib plots. <br>

Analysis Methods: <br>
Throughout the project, we employed various analysis methods to gain insights into song popularity and its influencing factors.These methods include:

1. Correlation Analysis: Examining the correlation between different audio features and the popularity score to identify any significant relationships.
2. Statistical Analysis: Employing statistical techniques to explore the distribution of data, identify outliers, and derive meaningful conclusions.
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.
4. Graphical Analysis and Visualization: Creating visual representations, such as scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms, to explore patterns and trends in the data. <br>

Findings: <br>
Through the analysis of the Spotify dataset, we discovered several noteworthy findings regarding the factors that contribute to a song's popularity. Some of the key findings include:<br>

1. Danceability, Energy, and Valence: Songs with higher danceability, energy, and valence tend to have higher popularity scores. <br>
2. Acousticness and Instrumentalness: Songs with higher acousticness and instrumentalness tend to be less popular among listeners. <br>
These findings provide valuable insights into the characteristics of popular songs on Spotify and can assist musicians, record labels, and music enthusiasts in understanding the factors that resonate with listeners. <br>

Conclusion:<br>
By leveraging the power of Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project has successfully analyzed the Spotify dataset to gain insights into the factors influencing song popularity. The findings highlight the significance of danceability, energy, valence, as well as the impact of acousticness and instrumentalness on a song's popularity. This project contributes to a deeper understanding of the elements that make a song appealing to a wide audience, and the findings can be utilized to inform music-related decision-making processes in the industry.
